<h2>Hello user!</h2>
This is my pokedex. 
You should be able to view a version of this site on https://hsedwards.github.io/pokedex/ 

All it does now is produce basic information about a pokemon that you search for by name.
Names must be spelled correctly but can be any combonation of lower case and capital letters. There is also a pit chart which will deisplay their statistics in an incredibly ineffective way. But, the chart will update with each new pokemon.

Here is what else you will need:

<h2>Gatsby-</h2>
Make sure you can run a gatsby project: npm install -g gatsby-cli

Use: npm run develop
to start the server and then go to http://localhost:8000 to see edits in real time.

<h2>D3-</h2>
use: npm i d3
to import the d3 library
