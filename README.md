Hello user!
This is my pokedex. You need to install axios to use. But other than that, it exists in all its current glory.

In theory you are able to view a working version of this website at the link https://hsedwards.github.io/pokedex/ 

All it does now is produce basic information about a pokemon that you search for by name.
Names must be spelled correctly.
